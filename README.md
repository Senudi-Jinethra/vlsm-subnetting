# vlsm-subnetting
VLSM stands for Variable Length Subnet Masking. This is a network addressing technique. By using this we can divide a network into subnets of different sizes. This maximize the efficiency of IP address allocation.

This project documents a simple example of how to use VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking.

## problem
Given the network 192.168.10.0/24, create subnets for:
- subnet with 20 hosts
- subnet with 100 hosts
- subnet with 10 hosts
- subnet with 50 hosts

## steps
### 1. Arrange the subnets in descending order
- Subnet A: 100 hosts
- Subnet B: 50 hosts
- Subnet C: 20 hosts
- Subnet D: 10 hosts
